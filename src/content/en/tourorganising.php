		<h3>Tour Organising</h3>
		<p>I am a tour organiser with years of proven experience in planning every aspect of a tour; 
		including managing the travel itinerary, booking coaches, hotels, restaurants and negotiating prices.
		I have a network of contacts in the tourism industry with whom I am often able to secure special rates.</p>
		<p>I can offer tailor-made tours in all areas of England, Scotland and Wales. I specialize in tours of the South of England (Kent &amp; Sussex) including many popular castles and gardens, e.g. Hever, Sissinghurst, Penshurst, Petworth House.</p>
		<p>I also organise historical/themed tours such as "On the Trail of Henry VIII", "Gardens of Kent &amp; Sussex" and more.</p>

		information about my experience and qualifications.</p>
